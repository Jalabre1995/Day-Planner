# Day-Planner
Day-Planner -Project for UCONN Coding Bootcamp

This file contains four files. An index.html, style.css, and sscript.js, and moment.js file. The project was to create a day planner between 9am to 5pm.
And the goal is to have anythign that is typed into the text saved into local storage. And when you refresh the page, the text is still there.
In addition to the local storage, I was also told to use moment.js, which is an Date and time API that has to be used in the planner.
Our goal with the moment.js file is to have the current time on the planner highlight as green. The previous times as red, and the current time as grey.
When you look at my code, you will see that when you type a text in the textarea save and refresh the page, the text is gone. But the text is stored in thelocal storage. I am having a problem getting the text to stay in the textinput. I would love to hear any feeback about the project.
